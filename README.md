Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project, we set out to create a smart thermostat using the Texas Instruments SimpleLink SDK and a CC3220 Launchpad. The main goal was to build an effective temperature control system for a specific setup. We pieced everything together, including UART, I2C, GPIO, and a well-structured state machine, to adjust the thermostat and play with the LEDs based on the temperature. The way we organized the code and explained things made it very user-friendly and easy to tweak.

What did you do particularly well?
The project is strong when it comes to how well it's organized and how clear it is. It's neatly structured, with functions and clear comments that explain everything in detail. What really stands out is how it handles the thermostat and LEDs using a state machine, which makes the code easy to follow and tweak.

Where could you improve?
To make the project even better, we could add some savvy ways to deal with errors and issues, especially when things like setting up hardware or talking over I2C don't go as planned. Providing clear error messages and clever recovery tricks would make the code more robust and dependable.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
For this project, I learned a lot from GitHub and videos on Udemy. Udemy will be added to my support network in the future. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
This project gave me some really useful skills in microcontroller coding, making hardware work smoothly, and creating state machines. These skills are super handy for all sorts of projects involving embedded systems and IoT.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The code is easy to maintain and understand because it has clear function and variable names, detailed comments explaining each part of the code, and it's neatly organized into separate functions for different jobs. This modular setup not only makes it flexible for future improvements or changing project requirements but also ensures the code is consistently easy to read.
